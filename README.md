# rotating_cube_ppm
A minimal C++ implementation​ that renders a rotating 3D cube​ and outputs each frame as a PPM image sequence. No external dependencies—pure standard library code (C++17 or later). Ideal for learning software rendering, 3D transformation basics, or generating input for video/animation pipelines.
